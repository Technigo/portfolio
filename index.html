        <!-- SUMMARY SECTION This is the section where you summarise what you have been doing in the past 
          and what you are wanting to do in the future. 
          This gives the reader an idea of who you are. Keep it short and personal.-->
        <article>

        </article>

        <!-- TECH SECTION (list technologies) 
        Give a short summary/name dropping of all the technologies, tools, libraries and things that you know 
        and will know during this course. 
        It's really the more the merrier here.-->

        <!-- FEATURED PROJECTS (my projects so far)
        Put the projects that you are most proud of here. Make sure to mention all technologies, libraries or 
        APIs that you have used. Don't feel like you are repeating yourself. As a recruiter looking for a 
        React developer – the more React is mentioned – the better. I you have other code projects that are 
        not related to this course, feel free to add them too. Link your projects to their Github page and 
        **make sure the whole area is a link**, meaning the image, headline and text.-->

        <!-- OTHER PROJECTS (lorem ipsum articles to come)
        Put all of your other projects here. The more the merrier. -->

        <!-- MY THOUGHTS (lorem ipsum links for now) 
        When you do add links in this section in the future make sure that the whole area is clickable and a link,
        meaning the image, headline and text.  -->

        <!-- SKILLS (code, upcoming, toolbox) 
        Place ALL your skills here. Feel free to add tech skills that are not in the course but things you have since 
        before. In the other columns, place everything that you think will be useful for a job in tech. Softwares 
        that you know, methodologies, leadership frameworks and basically whatever. -->

# portfolio

The living document.

During week eight of the Technigo Bootcamp it was time to start building a portfolio, showing stuff I've learned so far when it comes to html and css mostly. But we were also introduced to webaccessibility and I discovered there's a lot to take into consideration in order to build an accessible website. 

My portfolio is by no means finished, so the work continues.

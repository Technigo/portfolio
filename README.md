# My portfolio

This project was a part of Technigo Bootcamp and the assignment was to create a portfolio page which will update with all my projects that I finish. 

I created my own design and chose to keep it quite simple with a card for each project. I did not include too much information about my self since I'm not looking for employment but doing this course to boost the in house knowledge at the agency I'm a partner at. 

Part of the assignment was to create a page which is accessable to everyone, including those with disabilites. I have not yet made it work for screenreaders and will keep working on this project. Unfortunately, I was sick most of the week so lost a lot of time...

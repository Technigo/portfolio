# portfolio

This project was about creating our own portfolio with HTML and CSS. We were supposed to focus on accessibility and cross browser testing. We were also supposed to follow a design at Figma.

I started my work with the portfolio by mobile first and created all of the HTML, then I started with the CSS and tried to follow the design at Figma as much as I could. I found it difficult to follow a design like that, I have never done anything like that before and it took so much longer time than I thought. I didnt succeed as well as I hoped, it just took too long time for me.

When I was done I tested the accessibility and I also tried a screen reader to see if it worked.
I tested the code with W3C Markup Validation Service
and CSS Validator and got some errors which I fixed.
If I had more time I would have tried to make it more like the Figma design and added ARIA in the code.

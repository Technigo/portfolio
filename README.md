## The built & challanges
This week was putting my HTML and CSS skills to a test ðŸ¤¯ This includes planning for creating and displaying the content so it appeals to the goal of the project. Which creating a portfolio that showcases my projects. 

- The page was built with HTML and CSS (flexbox and Grid)
- The page is fully responsive. (mobile, tablet and desktop)
- The page has been tested in diffferend browsers (Chrome, Firefox, and Edge).
- The page includes web accessability and validated in  https://wave.webaim.org/ .
- The page has been tested towards a screen reader & keyboard navigation.


ðŸ‘‰The Challanges  that occur was trying to match the code with the figma layout, such as alignment in CSS using flexbox and Grid since there are many different ways to do this. So alot of trouble shooting and googling in CSS was included. Furhter also to make the styling appealing, (font-size, icons and pictures and links).

ðŸ‘‰Another challange was web accessiblity testing, since it is considering a lot of different aspects to be included in the code, such as Semantic HTML (elements used for right purpose) aria labeling and tools for testing (screen reader and automation). The approach is systematic and continous iteration to make sure the accesiblity goals are met byt testing continously. 

ðŸ‘‰NEXT is adding more content as the bootcamp evolves and a bit more styling.

# struggles

The portfolio is still under construction. I started off with mobile view and did everything with flexboxes, when that was finished and I continued to media queries for tablet and desktop I struggled with flex-wrapping and I really felt that both the HTML and CSS code that I had writted was too messy and unorganised for me to try to fix it.

I started fresh, creating a new HTML and CSS file with the intention to implement CSS grids instead of flexbox on the project section and thougts section amongst other. I have never worked with grids before, but have really wanted to learn it, so now that I really felt that I was in need of more dimensions than flexbox could offer me I took the opportunity to try and learn it. I actually somewhat pulled it off, which makes me so happy, now I have another tool in my toolbox for upcoming projects, my skills with the tool needs some sharpening though. I also implemented much of the font-sizes, colors, etc.. from the first attempt to try to be as effective as possible.

Another issue that I really noticed with this projects is the moment 22 of the need to set up the HTML correctly from the start but at the same time not knowing exactly what you will need. This is also one of the reasons I wanted to start over with the portfolio.

index.html and style.css is the first and failed attempt.
index-two.html and style-two.css is the second attempt that I'm currently building on.

I will continue on with the media-queries from tablet and desktop and adding some hovering-effects etc. The colors and images on the site right now are just placeholders and will be replaced with thought-through replacers.

Lastly I will validate the files and add accessibility functionality.


UPDATE 11/4:

I have implemented some logics for the projects with JavaScript to render the projects from an array.
The color scheme has been replaced and I have switched from an image to a linear background color in the heading.

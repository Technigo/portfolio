## About this thing
Well this was a project that took way longer than i thought! Even though the design wasn't up for debate i still felt i had to spend a whole day in Figma just trying to add my own flare or whatever... :) Anyway, even though we have done a few projects now, i still feel like i learn a lot from every new project in terms of css structure. It seems to me that making smart css-decisions is relly important for making the code understandable as it grows. 
The main thing this week was accessibility, and unfortunately i didnt really have time to get to that. I have run the W3C markup validator without errors, and i've tried to choose semantic tags as much as possible, but beyond that i'm going to have to get back to this project and make some adjustments later on, in terms of accessibility.

## If i hade more time...
- I'm still not happy with the layout, it feels a bit clumsy and big so i would like to improve on that a bit. 
- I had planned to render the html from JavaScript, and store all the content in an object so that i later on can replace that with some kind of cool backend solution. 
- I was kind of curious to try something like this https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/fluid-typography/ i suppose there are some drawbacks to it but it seems kind of neat. I would also like to use em or rem for some measurements that have to do with responsiveness (like side padding or padding between sections) - and then changing the 'root element' along with page width. Perhaps that could mean needing fewer breakpoint overrides in the css, i would like that. 
- I want to improve some old projects so i can include them in the portfolio but i have a feeling there will be plenty to do the coming weeks so we'll see i guess. I also want to add more old 'non-frontend' projects, but let's see what my career mentor has to say about that.

# portfolio

This week I started on my portfolio. The design was from a figma sketch but with my own personal picture. 
Right now itÂ´s more of a template and not a live portfolio. Lorem text etc. 

First time I "copy" a design. That was a challange to make everything look like someone else wanted it to look. But I think I did quite well in the end. 
I tried to make a png whit a transparent background on my profile picture which I think turned out well. 
I also used tinypng.com to make some images smaller to increas the load speed of the page.

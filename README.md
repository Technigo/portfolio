# portfolio

A portfolio to present projects, articles and skills.

The webpage is developed with the mobile-first approach. 
The layoute is mainly based on flexbox. For accessability purposes 
I used semantic HTML tags and aria-lable where more information was neede. 
To hidde purely decorative elements I used aria-hidden.

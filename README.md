## Workflow

### The Layout
I began by working through the design provided to us by Technigo. I decided to add sections from top to bottom (i.e. Header->Footer). After I had completed a section I tested it (see testing process below) to make sure everything worked as intended. 

<br>

### Testing
After a section was complete I went through a loose testing checklist I made for myself.

> 1. Screenreader (Win 10, Chrome, Application: [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/))
>   - Are the elements available to the screen reader in the correct order?
>   - Navigate through the section while closing my eyes. Can I do it and understand what the section contains?
> 2. Keyboard navigation
>   - If the section contains any links or interactions, make sure I can navigate through them and to them using only the keyboard.
> 3. Responsiveness
>   - Make sure the section looks the same in the following formats:
>       - Phone
>       - Tablet
>       - Desktop
>       - 4K resolutions
> 4. Crossbrowser testing (full test to be done on website compl.)
>   - Make sure the section works the same in Chrome as in Firefox and Edge

### Testing with a screenreader
After doing some research I found that if you only have the time to do *some* screenreader testing you should do it using [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/). It is currently the most common application used by people in need. 

So I downloaded it and began to use it. It took me a few hours before I got some usability from it. I also learned (from various blogs and instructionals) that screen readers have quick-commands that users utilize when browsing the web (such as the *View all Landmarks* and *Get all lists* or *Get all links*). Since those are function people commonly use when using a screen reader I decided to make sure that my site was easy to experience using those short commands. 

One change I had to do for that to work was to change how I displayed my projects and blog posts. Instead of using an article tag it was apparently more useful for accessibility tools to have them listed using `<ul></ul>`.

So I changed this:
```js
<div class="projects__flexbox">
    <article class="project project--feature" aria-labelledby="project2">
    <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank" rel="external">
        <div class="project__title">
            <h2 class="project" id="project2">PROJECT TITLE</h2>
        </div>  
        <p class="project__description">DESCRIPTION OF TITLE.</p>
        <p class="project__text">Write short what the project is about and what technoglogies you’ve used.</p>       
    </a>
    </article>
</div>
```
INTO THIS:
```js
<ul class="cards__list" aria-label="List of Featured Projects">
    <li class="card" aria-labelledby="projectID">
        <div class="card__title--featured">
            <img src="./assets/project-alex.png" alt="screenshot from the game" />
            <h2 class="featured">
                <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank" id="projectID">MY TITLE</a>
            </h2>
        </div>
        <p class="primary primary--bold">DESCRIPTION OF TITLE.</p>
        <p>Write short what the project is about and what technoglogies you’ve used.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
```

> 💡 The intersting change here is that when using an `<ul>` the screen reader will actually give the user a good overview of all the lists on the site, since that tag has the `aria-role="list"` as default. 

<br>

> ‼️ PLEASE NOTE: I did not come up with this design. When doing my research into writing good html for screen readers almost everyone recommended (apart from the official guidelines of course) a website promoting inclusive html design components. This is the [LINK](https://inclusive-components.design/)
> I also noticed that using a pseudo element to make the link work is what is expected in accessibility. Found [THIS](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-links-and-buttons/) article about that.

### Creating a dynamic data system
Since I knew I was going to add to this project throughout the weeks of this bootcamp, I wanted to create a solution for me to do so easily without having to go into the html file. 

So I made a few functions in the **app.js** file that loads in some javascript objects with data. That data is then rendered onto the site using my "templates".

I also think that in the future, after we've worked with databases and React templates, I can migrate this website into using those methodologies with ease since the deisgn is already made with a dynamic system in mind.  

<br>

### The final testing suite
Finally the website was done! It looked great and worked as intended, or so I hoped at least. It was indeed time for the last test suite. I had already before-hand made an extensive list of what platforms to test on.

For all cross-platform and cross-browser testing I used [lambdatest](https://app.lambdatest.com/console/realtime). A somewhat free service to test multiple devices. 

Here is the list I used:
- Responsive:
  - mobile
    - iphone x
    - iphone 6/7/8
    - motog4            
  - tablet
    - ipad
    - ipad pro
  - desktop
    - laptop hidpi
    - laptop mdpi
    - 4k 2560px
- Crossbrowser:
  - Desktop:
    - chrome
      - win10
      - macOS
    - edge
      - win10
      - macOS
    - firefox
      - win10
      - macOS
  - safari (any major issue??)
      - macOS
  - Mobile:
    - chrome (iphone)
    - edge (iphone)
    - firefox (iphone)
    - safari (iphone) - only major issues!
- Accessibility:
  - keyboard navigation
  - screen reader
- Verification tool:
  - run lighthouse (chrome devtools)
  - run wave evaltool (bookmarked in chrome)

## Reflections
All in all this project was not filled with any major issues. I worked through the requirements with ease. However, no project is without issues...


**ISSUES**

- I struggled a bit in the beginning trying to follow along in the already set up code. Especially since I found some bugs in that code. So the preparation phase on day 1 did take longer than I had planned. But after chaging the structure to be more easy to read it went smoothly.
- Since I decided to make the cards flippable (and CSS is not my strong suit), that process did take longer than any javascript process. But when I found an instructional I wanted to follow and get inspired by, I learned from that and found a dynamic way to apply the functionality into my project. 

<br>

If I were to continue on this project / start over I would:

# portfolio

This project is made during Technigo bootcamp.

This project was about buildning a porfolio using HTML and CSS and also to make it accessible and make som accessibility testing and cross-browser testing.

I used flexbox for the layout but feel that I had wanted more time to figure things out about the position of some items. I'm still not satisfied with some of the contents positioning. I ran my code in the w3 validator and it passed with only 1 warning. I also made a couple of color contrast validations with different results. One of them (wave report) sad that I had bad contrast on the text I have on top of my pictures. I know I have choosen a difficult background picture when it comes to good contrast color in the header. The icons in the header are also hard to see when the desktop gets to big. It will probably be easier to change the pictures then find a better color, but I do love the background picture. I changed some of the other colors after the tests and they passed the tests after that. I added tabindex for screenreaders. I tried googles screenreader out and I think it worked okey. If I had more time I would have spent more time on flexbox and contrast-colors.

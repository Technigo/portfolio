# Isabella's Portfolio

This is my portfolio I built using HTML and CSS. I also added a bit of ARIA attributes to make the website more accessible. ðŸ˜¸âœ¨

My portfolio contains projects I built in the Technigo boot camp using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Styled components and APIs. Since the boot camp isn't over yet, I will continuously add projects where I showcase my latest learned technologies. 

My short term goal for my portfolio website is to build it using React and GitHub's API to fetch my project's repositories. 


## Accessibility testing

Here's an overview of the testing I've done on my portfolio website. 

- The page is responsive and tested on different devices accessible to me in Chrome Dev tools
- The page works fine on different browsers; Chrome, Edge and Firefox
- It's possible to navigate the page using only the keyboard (tab, arrows and enter)
- The page has been run through HTML validators with no errors; W3C Markup validation service and Lighthouse in Chrome Dev tools
- Ran an audit using WAVE (wave.webaim.org); the page received no errors. There are some contrast errors that I intend to fix asap.
- The content of the page is still readable and understandable without the CSS; used the Google Chrome Web Developer tool to remove all the CSS
- The page has been tested with a screen reader (NVDA) with good results

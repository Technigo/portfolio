# The Portfolio

The assignment was to create a porfolio based on a provided design in HTML and CSS.

## The problem

My biggest issue was that I started off making more generic CSS-classes for items such as headers, text etc. and that created a ridiculous amount of issues after a while. Going into this project I thought it was going to be fairly easy and laidback, but when all the CSS classes started to intertwine it created an inception of classes where solving one just created an issue somewhere else. This combined with responsiveness and cross browser testing (only one browser should be allowed to exist!!!) made things much more difficult than they needed to be and so very time consuming with things I normally have no problems with. I learned that it's always better investing the time building a good structure in the beginning rather then untangeling a mess which is way more time consuming in the long run.

My biggest help in solving this, as well as I could in the time frame, was playing around in the dev tool in the browser and with that figuring out from where the classes were inheriting styles.

Something else I learned is the difference in free coding your own ideas and following a design. Practice will hopefully make (more) perfect!
There are definetly more things to fix to make the site better (and for it to represent me), but I see it as a living project that I'll continue to perfect.

Basically it's been surprisingly frustrating and I'm so eager to get better at it and to start with React!

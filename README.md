# portfolio
This weeks project was about setting up my porfolio. The focus codewise was on HTML and CSS. 
We got an already set up design on Figma, which we had to follow. The goal was to set it up exactly like the given desing except for the color. Testing and accessibility were components of this weeks project. 

Before this project I thought I had a quite good understanding of the Flexbox model, but I somehow had a hard time with it on this project. Following the given design was much harder than I thought. I think my HTML and CSS became complicater and longer than it would have, when I didn't have to follow a design. I didn't have a particular problem, just a hard time wrapping my head around how to set up the html for the flexbox. In the future I'll check out the design more in detail and "translate" it into flexbox and not just start right away. 

I lost quite a lot of time with the styling and set up of the structure, which didn't leave much time for testing. I'll need to work on the text, pictures and color later on. And of course testing will be a continuous part of projects.

If I had more time I'd focus on make a shorter, clearer and easier to read code and also I'd put in more time with the testing. Also my site can't be controled with a keyboard. Will also work on that

# Project: Build your portfolio

This was a very exciting project as we got the assignment to build our portfolio. We put into practice our CSS skills and we got introduced to accesibility (testing, UX design, validation, etc).

# What I learned and how I build it.

- I went mobile first as I find it easier to go from small and stacked sections to wider and more complex displays.

-I was carefull in building the layout of this project so I started writing the markup in this order: header, section 1, 2 and 3, section 4, 5, 6 and finally the section last 2 sections.

- After being done with HTML I validated that part of code, I made the changes needed, then I styled it, and tested it again. I strongly avoided to go too far without testing my code.

I left till the very end adding a few ARIA labels but I will probably need to add a few more.

- My site is responsive and accesible for mobile, ipad and desktop.

- I tested my page on my Iphone 8 plus, my Ipad and my Mac of 15".

- I tested my website in Chrome, Safari and Edge.

- The validators that I used were Wave and validator.w3.org and aslo web.dev that uses Lighthouse. My website scored 85 for Accesibility, 80 for Best Practices and 92 for SEO. I would appreciate feedback to improve my score for Accesibility and Best practices.

- The HTML code makes sense even without the styling.

- I tested my page with Voice Over off from Mac and it is also accesible with the keyboard.

This is still a work in progress and there are improvements to be done. I will keep making improvements and adding my projects continuisly.

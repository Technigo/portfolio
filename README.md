Build your portfolio

This was a very exciting project as we got the assignment to build our portfolio. We put into practice our CSS skills and we got introduced to accesibility (testing, UX design, validation, etc).

What I learned and how I build it.

- I went mobile first as I find it easier to go from small and stacked sections to wider and more complex displays.
  -I was extra cerefull in building the layout of this project so I started writing the markup in this order: header, section 1, 2 and 3, section 4, 5, 6 and finally the section last 2 sections.

-After being done with HTML I validated that part of code, I made the changes needed, then I styled it, and tested it again. I strongly avoided to go too far without testing my code.

I left till the very end adding a few ARIA labels but I will probably need to add a few more.

- My site is responsive and accesible for mobile, ipad and desktop.

- I tested my page on my Iphone 8 plus, my Ipad and my Mac of 15".

- I tested my website in Chrome, Safari and Edge.

- The va validators that I used were Wave and validator.w3.org

- I tested my page with Voice Over off from Mac.

This is still a work in progress and there are improvements to be done. I will keep making improvements and adding my projects continuisly.

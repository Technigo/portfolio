Simply my portfolio. 

The website is built with only HTML and CSS and it's responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop. I have added aria labels for accessibility and 
have run the web site through wave and w3 validators as well as tested the page with Narrator on Windows, and Voice over on Mac. 

I have followed a design mockup given to us by Technigo. 

More content will be added as I progress during the Technigo frontend-developer bootcamp.

My Portfolio Website

The task was to build an attractive portfolio website by following a design made by Technigo.

For this week's project, I was focusing on HTML, CSS, accessibility and testing. I decided to leave the content for later update. This is something I would have done if I had more time. 

I made the website with mobile-first approach and used flexbox for most of the structure and CSS grid in some parts where it seemed to be more appropriate.

The most challenging parts were the following of an already set design and the accessibility as a topic in general. In terms of design, I tried to follow all the parameters given in Figma's design. And in terms of accessibility, I read a lot of information on the internet and also researched questions / answers on Stack Overflow. And I also rewatched a recorded Technigo session on this topic.

For accessibility purposes I tried to use semantic HTML as much as possible and I also used an aria-hidden to hide purely decorative content and an aria-label to add extra information to elements, such as div. To test accessibility  for my website I used W3C Validation, WAVE and NVDA screen reader.

Techniques: HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox, CSS-grid, ARIA, Responsive design, Mobile-first design 
Tools: VS Code, Live Server, Figma, W3 Validation, WAVE, NVDA, unsplash.com, Slack, StackOverflow, Google Chrome,Firefox, Microsoft Edge.

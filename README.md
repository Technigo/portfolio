# portfolio

The portfolio assignment was initialised during week 8 of the Technigo Boot Camp, but will remain an ongoing project where we keep adding new information and content throughout the entire course.

The site had to be built in HTML and CSS and using Flexbox for layout purposes. It had to be fully responsive in various views (mobile, tablet, desktop) - and look and function the same in Chrome, Firefox and Edge. I used a more detailed range of media queries than ever before to cover as many devices as possible.

We were given a set design for mobile and desktop view that we were to implement if taking part in the Techingo Career Coaching Program, which I am. Images and the actual text content naturally had to be our own, and we were also allowed to change and personalise the color scheme if preferred. I took the opportunity to do so, for the visual impression to correlate better with my content and reflect back on my artistic preference of color use for this project. Some of my content is currently dummy text, as there are certain topics I´d like to discuss with my future career coach before I fill these in. And some sections (e.g. “My thoughts” articles) are up and coming tasks for us to do during the Career Coaching program.

A crucial part of the assignment was to carry out an accessibility test according to a checklist, making sure the webpage works well for people with disabilities. As an extension to this the HTML code had to validate in a validation tool, and I have also checked so that all colors and color contrast are acceptable and approved. I´ve run my code through the WAVE and Tenon auditing tools and applied suggested changes. When I have more time I will focus on fine tuning and adding additional ARIA attributes, to improve the accessibility of the page for people using a screen reader and keyboard navigation.

I´ll keep coming back to this project, not only for adding new content - but also to adjust some of the flexbox layout that I´m not happy with. I also plan to replace the hero image for a non cropped version of the current photo in tablet and desktop view.

<h1>Portfolio</h1>🎨🖌️💻

Pheww! 8 weeks have passed since the beginning of the bootcamp. What a ride! Now we are already working on our portfolios to showcase all the exciting new things that we are able to build.😀

<h2>Technologies that I used</h2>

At this stage in the bootcamp, we are learning about the importance of accessibility: everybody should be able to use and enjoy our websites😀. For this matter we have learned about:
<ul>
  <li>HTML5.</li>
  <li>CSS3</li>
  <li>Web content accessibility.</li>
  <li>Unit tests.</li>
  <li>Cross browser testing.</li>
  <li>Aria attributes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I've learned</h2>👓
Planning is fundamental when it comes to achieving good results in a short timeframe. As I'm still learning how to handle properly handle CSS3, I wasn't left with much time to perform a good testing. I could also see how our favorite design elections are not always the best in terms of usability. It shocked me to see how important it is to be both esthetically and practically sharp in order to build a great quality product.

# Portfolio

The goal of this project was to create a portfolio using a given design.

## The problem

The biggest challenge was getting as close as possible to the given design for all screen-sizes. This was a great opportunity to get to know Figma and work detail-oriented, which suited me very well.

I also did some cross-browser testing (for Chrome, Firefox and Edge) as well as accessibility testing.

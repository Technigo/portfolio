# Project - Build your portfolio
    -follow given design
    -apply html and css
    -make it accessible

Sounds easy, it was not!    


# The approach

    - I chose to follow a given design for the portfolio layout and I decided to make use of css grid. The grid system took some time and effort to get to know, however it's a technique with many possibilities. With that said and think i might have used it a bit inproperly throughout my project. I was able to benifit frpm placing element according to a grid but still struggled with positioning an centering, especially after altering content depending on viewport.

    It has taken me a lot of time to put out i site that just is ok layout wise and and don't really know why it has taken so long, I have really put in the hours and then some...

    An exemple with my stuggle can be found between the project section and the thought section. Both have a grid, but the project also have alternate picture src depending on VP. The thought section don't instead the picture adapt to the content with max-width and looks good but a proper picture would get distorted..?


# The learnings

    altough it has been a rough week i really enjoyed getting to know css grid, I see this as a really resourceful tool. Also I needed the practise in CSS even if veerything is far from perfect.

     - note to self in upcoming projects
        * Get to know your projects, break it into smaller chunks
        * Look for the lowest common denominator, and apply style accordingly
        * Work section by secttion and avoid trying to do all at once
        * Can you buy more time?

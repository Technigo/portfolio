# portfolio

Project Brief:
Create my own portfolio for future career.

This projects focus was on creating a portfolio with a design mockup given by Technigo through Figma.
It is mainly built with HTML, CSS and responsive design mobile first, tablet and desktip. I have added aria labels, tabindex for web accessibility. 

I have run my website through wave and w3 validators but if i had more time i would put more focus on this (which will be an ongoing assignment). The same regarding testing of different web browsers. This i had no time to do this week.
